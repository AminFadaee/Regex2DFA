Regular Expression to DFA
=========================
## Introduction:
This project converts and arbitrary regular expression (Regex) to a DFA using the `Felan` algorithm by conducting the following steps:

1. Converting the Regex to post-order format
2. Creating the Annotated Syntax Tree of the Regex
3. Creating the DFA based on the tree.

## Documentation

The code is documented using Google Style Docstring but for a detailed documentation on the algorithm and code, read the  [documentation.md](https://github.com/AminFadaee/Regex2DFA/blob/master/Documentation.md)

## Requirements

* Python Version 3+
* General Knowledge of Regular Expressions and Finite State Automatas

## Running:

Run the project by running [Regex2DFA.py](https://github.com/AminFadaee/Regex2DFA/blob/master/Regex2DFA.py)

Here is the results for [Input1.txt](https://github.com/AminFadaee/Regex2DFA/blob/master/Inputs/Input1.txt) located in the inputs directory:
```

```

and [input2.txt](https://github.com/AminFadaee/Traveling_Sales_Man_Genetic/blob/master/input2.txt) :

Both runs use the following parameters:

* n = 20
* k = 100
* max_generation = 1000
* crossover_probability = 0.99
* mutation_probability = 0.01
